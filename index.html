			<h2>More about Clones</h2>
			<p>
				A whole bunch of text about clones is supposed to be placed here in order for me to create a fake document
				that I can submit and also get some very much needed typing practice all at the same time and make myself 
				more efficient and possibly just have fun with continueing to create run-on sentences for no reason at all
				its life==+ hearts.

				Yea boy im adding a new paragraph that im enjoying typing and ill skip out on capital letters
				if i need to survive the hunt for red october and boy am I looking forward to making myself
				type and code things all day everyday tragically for the rest of my existence haha to funny
				die qoutes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Add another p type some fucking things and concepts and whatever the hell else is on my 
				mind at the time of recording and making these things happen that make me lots of money
				and money and shit that I dont really need to make up a whole bunch of fucking nonsense.

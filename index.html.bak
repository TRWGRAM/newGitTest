			<h2>More about Clones</h2>
			<p>
				A whole bunch of text about clones is supposed to be placed here in order for me to create a fake document
				that I can submit and also get some very much needed typing practice all at the same time and make myself 
				more efficient and possibly just have fun with continueing to create run-on sentences for no reason at all
				its life==+ hearts.
